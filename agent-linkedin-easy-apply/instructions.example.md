## Blacklist
Judge each job against these as you go. If a job matches ANY item, call skip_job
immediately and move on — never apply, never partially fill it. This overrides the
answering policy: when in doubt between applying and skipping a blacklisted job, SKIP.
- Company (match loosely, including obvious name variants and misspellings): Example Corp.
- Any application that asks you to enter or select EDUCATION DATES (start date, end date,
  graduation date, dates attended, year of graduation) for a school/degree. Do NOT guess
  dates and do NOT fight the field — skip the whole job.
- Any REQUIRED field that makes you pick a specific school / university / degree from a
  list and yours is not selectable.
- Add more companies or criteria below, one per line.

## Answering policy
You genuinely want the job — answer to maximize getting an interview, make the best
favorable judgment from the data below, never play it safe, and never leave a required
field blank.
- Comfort / logistics / eligibility (comfortable commuting, onsite/hybrid/remote, willing
  to relocate, authorized to work, can you start soon, 18+, willing to travel): always pick
  the affirmative option — Yes.
- Experience / skill ("do you have N years of X", specific tech): answer Yes when your
  resume supports it, picking the most favorable plausible option; for a number, enter one
  consistent with your resume.
- Only answer No when a screening answer below says so.
- If unsure, choose the most favorable plausible answer and keep going.
- Reminders / interstitials / confirmation pop-ups (e.g. a "safety reminder" with "Continue
  applying"): always proceed — click the button that continues; never "Review", "Cancel",
  or anything that backs out.
- If a job matches the Blacklist above, skip it (call skip_job) instead of applying.

## Screening question answers
Set these to your own values.
- Authorized to work in the country? Yes
- Require visa sponsorship (now or in the future)? No

- Work arrangement: open to remote, hybrid, and onsite
- Desired salary: <your number, or "negotiable">
